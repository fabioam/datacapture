# DataCapture

A class used to accepts numbers and returns an object for querying
statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports
querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater
than a value, or within a range.

The methods add(), less(), greater(), and between() should have
constant time O(1)
